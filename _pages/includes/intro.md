👋 Hi there! I am Shaowu Tang (唐 绍武 in Chinese), a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.usc.edu/)), working under the supervision of Prof. [Hangbo Zhao](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Zhao/Hangbo). Previously, I obtained my M.Eng. degree from Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)) in June 2025, advised by Prof. [Jian S. Dai](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/daijiansheng.html) and Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085463419), and my B.Eng. degree from the [Mao Yisheng Honors College](https://mys.swjtu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm), Southwest Jiaotong University ([SWJTU](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/)) in June 2022.

Please feel free to contact me at shaowuta@usc.edu

<!-- My research interests focus on micro/nano-scale sensor systems, leveraging biomimetic structures and micro/nano-fabrication techniques to develop sophisticated sensors inspired by highly refined biological systems. I am particularly excited about the future of intelligent robots equipped with advanced sensing capabilities that have the potential to enhance everyday life.

Outside of research, I enjoy running and cycling, following sports and economic news, and learning about the history and culture of different countries and regions. -->



<!-- 👋 Hi there! I am Shaowu Tang (唐 绍武 in Chinese), a 3rd-year Master’s student at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)). My research primarily focuses on **_Soft Robotics_** and **_Bio-inspired robotics_**, including their structural design, control, and sensing methodologies. These research works are conducted under the supervision and guidance of Prof. [Jian S. Dai](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/daijiansheng.html) and Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085463419). Prior to this, I obtained my B.Eng. Degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Mao Yisheng Honors College](https://mys.swjtu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm), Southwest Jiaotong University ([SWJTU](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/)) in June 2018.

In the Fall of 2025, I will join the University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.usc.edu/)) and focus on the interdisciplinary research areas of **_Soft Robotics_** and **_Flexible Electronics_**. -->
