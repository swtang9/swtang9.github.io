üëã Hi there! I am Shaowu Tang (ÂîêÁªçÊ≠¶ in Chinese), a 3rd-year Master‚Äôs student at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). My research primarily focuses on *Soft Robotics* and *Bio-inspired robotics*, including their structural design, control, and sensing methodologies. These research works are conducted under the supervision and guidance of Prof. [Jian S. Dai](https://sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/daijiansheng.html) and Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/jiaozhiyuangong/896.html). Prior to this, I obtained my B.Eng. Degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Mao Yisheng Honors College](https://mys.swjtu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm), [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2018.

In the Fall of 2025, I will go to the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) to conduct interdisciplinary research in *Soft Robotics* and *Flexible Electronics*.

I received my Ph.D. degree from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/) <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/zju.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> in June 2024, affiliated with a joint program with [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) <a href="https://www.westlake.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/westlake.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> at [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) and advised by Prof. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/donglin-wang.html). Before that, I received my B.Eng. Degree from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) <a href="https://www.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/whu.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> in June 2019.

My research has centered on the **perception, understanding, reasoning, and generation of multimodal (images, videos, language, dynamics, etc.) data from both Internet and the physical world**. I also focus on improving the **efficiency** of building multimodal applications (in terms of data, training time, parameters, memory, etc.). I have published 20+ papers <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mhpkWSYAAAAJ" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?label=Paper%20Citations&query=total_citations&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcse.bth.se%2F~fer%2Fgooglescholar-api%2Fgooglescholar.php%3Fuser%3DmhpkWSYAAAAJ&logo=googlescholar&style=social" align="center" alt="Google Scholar"></a> on the above topics at the top international AI conferences. Recently, I devote myself to the development of multi-modal generative and unified foundation models.

I am honored to have supervised several self-motivated visiting students and research assistants in their research and publications. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at **siteng.huang**[AT]**gmail.com** (replace [AT] with @). Additionly, I maintain close cooperation with MiLAB from Westlake University, which is actively looking for visiting students and RAs (please refer to [Recruitment](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/contact.html)). Specially, if you are willing to cooperate with me there, please also send me a copy when sending your CV to the lab. -->
