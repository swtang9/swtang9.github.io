👋 Hi there! I am Shaowu Tang (唐绍武 in Chinese), a 3rd-year Master’s student at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). My research primarily focuses on **_Soft Robotics_** and **_Bio-inspired robotics_**, including their structural design, control, and sensing methodologies. These research works are conducted under the supervision and guidance of Prof. [Jian S. Dai](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/daijiansheng.html) and Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085463419). Prior to this, I obtained my B.Eng. Degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Mao Yisheng Honors College](https://mys.swjtu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm), [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2018.

In the Fall of 2025, I will join the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) and focus on the interdisciplinary research areas of **_Soft Robotics_** and **_Flexible Electronics_**.
